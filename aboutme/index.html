    <h2>Rachel Pazos</h2> 
    <p>Hello Everyone! I'm married with three children. I'm working on a degree in Applied Technology.  I like leaning about different 
        career paths in tech since I'm not sure what I'll end up doing with my degree.  I have loved studying online with BYUI as I have 
        been able to work with other people around the world.<p>

        </p>  I have been a member of the church my whole life and I love to learn all that I can 
about the gosple. I love being outdoors and listening to true crime podcasts while working around the house. My favorite podcasts are
Small Town Dicks, Morbid, and Crime Junkie. When I don't want to listen to crime, I like the Teaching with Power podcast as it really
dives into the scriptures.</p>
