Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

When I got better at using functions, I learned their value and what they could do.  I realized they could 
make the whole program come together.  I learned that if anything was off with a function the whole program 
wouldn't work.  I learned that using functions will make the program a lot easier and shorter to write.


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

Test functions are a wonderful tool that allows you to test your program to make sure that everything
is correct and save you a lot of time in the end.  If the program isn't tested and there is a problem
it won't be known until the end when you realize the program won't work and then it will take more time to 
go through the program to find and fix the mistake.


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

If Python notifies me of an error in my program, I look over it to find the mistake.  
I research the solution if needed.  When I finish the program, I can run pytest to find
any other errors.  One thing I can do to improve is to learn how to use pytest and other tests 
better and keep practicing using them.
